	Abstract = {{A}lthough the spike-trains in neural networks are mainly constrained by the neural dynamics itself, global temporal constraints (refractoriness, time precision, propagation delays, ..) are also to be taken into account. {T}hese constraints are revisited in this paper in order to use them in event-based simulation paradigms. {W}e first review these constraints, and discuss their consequences at the simulation level, showing how event-based simulation of time-constrained networks can be simplified in this context: the underlying data-structures are strongly simplified, while event-based and clock-based mechanisms can be easily mixed. {T}hese ideas are applied to punctual conductance-based generalized integrate-and-fire neural networks simulation, while spike-response model ({SRM}) simulations are also revisited within this framework. {A}s an outcome, a fast minimal complementary alternative with respect to existing simulation event-based methods, with the possibility to simulate interesting neuron models is implemented and experimented.},
